# Forza4

## How does it work?

**Forza4** is a two player game written in Java in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal **line of four of one's own tokens.**

## Requirements

In order to work properly, Forza4 requires:

- The **Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8+**
- The `Forza4.jar` file must be inside the **same directory** as the `images` folder

## Running the JAR file

To run the jar file, simply double-click on it or run the following command inside a terminal instance:

```sh
java -jar Forza4.jar 
```

## Compiling

The project also contains an exported instance of the Eclipse workspace project. This instance can be easily imported and compiled throught the Eclipse project
