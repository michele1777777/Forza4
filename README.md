# Forza4
**Forza4** is a two player game written in Java in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal **line of four of one's own tokens.**
